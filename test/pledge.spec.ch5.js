Chapter 5: Extra Credit: Static Methods `.resolve` and `.all`
---------------------------------------------------------
Promises on their own have very many advantages over
callbacks, chiefly when it comes to *composability* â€”
combining and orchestrating multiple asynchronous results.
That being said, practically every promise library provides
a couple of helper functions to make promise composition
even easier. In this chapter you will implement two of the
most crucial static methods, so useful they are part of the
ES6 spec for promises (EcmaScript goes beyond P/A+).
